Expertise is not the same as experience.

Following a recipe is not the same as preparing a meal, trying how it turned out and improving/tweaking it the next time.

We to want to get as much expertise as we can from as little experience as possible. But theyâ€™re not the same. From parenting to computer programming, experience matters.
