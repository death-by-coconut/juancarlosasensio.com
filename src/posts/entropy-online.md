What is the lifecycle of lifespan of a blog? A blog post? A tweet? A Tik Tok video?

A man whose name starts with Z is listed as the expert teaching a “UX Master Class”. He’s experienced, he works at IBM, he looks confident. He writes about the subject on Medium…or at least he used to. His latest blog post was published in 2017. Five years can be a long time for the Internet and digital technologies.

So, it’s interesting to me to reflect on my internal dialogue. I crave the expertise, the solidity of his knowledge and advice, but he hasn’t written about this stuff in a while. Is his stuff current? Has it been updated to reflect the new realities brought about by new technologies, new expectations?

And if I set out to start a blog, for how long will it remain current? Is there a need to factor the value of content when archived?
