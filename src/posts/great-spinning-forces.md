All the Great Forces,

gravity and natural disasters,

scientific discoveries and the mechanics of markets,

sins and sloth,

animal instincts,

insincere altruism,

fate and chance and chance and fate,

the miracle of life and babies making it through the tunnel of darkness,

it was mostly my neighborâ€™s off-hand commentary,

which confined me to the spin bike

from where I can write a verse in the name of efficiency 

and get a glimpse of eternity, rising above all the Great Forces.
