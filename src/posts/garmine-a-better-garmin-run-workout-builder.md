### Garmine: Improve upon the Garmin Mobile UI for creating a workout (UI only) 🏋️‍♀️ 🏋️‍♀️ 

Garmin's UI is clever. It "atomizes" inputs: a few buttons perform multiple different actions based on the screen ("context") they are in. Garmin also breaks down step "type" and step "duration".

* For example: step type can be "time" and so duration is in "minutes:seconds". If, instead, step type is "distance" duration is in "miles" or "kilometers"
* Probably can use React for this

    Stretch goal: connect UI to Garmin's Training API!! https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/training-api/
