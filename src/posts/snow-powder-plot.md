Here it comes again,

surprisingly,

just like the last time.

At the time before.

Things, all of them, remain in darkness.

Muted. They cease to move with curiosity.

They move to survive.

Mostly, they endure and remain, brave like statues.

It all happens in place, limit the radius, the agitation must come to an end.

Suddenly, a light shimmers, then blooms. Surprisingly, like the last time.

Itâ€™s not too late to recognize

the thoughts were all the same.
