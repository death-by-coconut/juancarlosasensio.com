The benefit of starting young is that confidence precedes direction. When I was younger, I’d much rather get going than wait around for clues and pointers. Man I thought I was and that was the end of my pondering, the start of the action. I toiled and toiled and forgot that, what I was indeed looking for, was a sense of direction.

Once on the road I’d made stops and meet people. The courtesies and mandates of the committed traveler díctate one must never wear out one’s welcome, nor choose to remain in any one place. The road is home and one settles into this home by way of movement and impermanence. When everything is transient, nothing is worthy of contemplation, any consideration is met with haste and all that is worrisome is swept under the carpet. Yet the road conspires with the gods and the soul, and patterns emerge from the flux of things; many faces beginning to blend into one, perhaps the one we miss the most; many places begin to look the same, evoking the same memory; many sorrows crystallize and joy, when it comes, hovers like a misty veil covering it all without discernment.

Now, years later, I am more settled and much of the road is behind me. The streets loop back to where I start shorter, less adventurous journeys. Unknowns abound, but there’s the semblance of something more stable to which I can retire to and spring back from, perhaps the next day or next month, with a vague sense of serenity around the home base. And from here, I long for the road. The one that stretches endlessly past the horizon and which, nevertheless, brought me here. And from here I imagine how the road, now distant and ghostly, can lead to nowhere and what traveling on it for too long can do to you.

I wish I could say that I’ve traded the confidence of bustling action for purposeful efforts of lesser intensity and higher efficacy. That the bouncy energy of the youth has been replaced by an endurance of wisdom and grace. But I’m in the solitary plains of the soul, feeling less compelled to act and more riddled with worry. I think two steps ahead and thus, from this biased future, consider all action with stifling skepticism. Beyond confidence there is nothing but the inkling of despair, and this is something to reckon with as one moves on.

So confidence is not followed by confidence. With the continuity broken, am I to do nothing but wait until I succumb to my worrying self, incapable of further action?
