The benefit of starting young is that confidence precedes direction. When I was younger, I’d much rather get going than wait around for clues and pointers. Man I thought I was and that was the end of my pondering, the start of the action. I toiled and toiled and forgot that, what I was indeed looking for, was a sense of direction.

Once on the road I’d made stops and meet people. The courtesies and mandates of the committed traveler dictate that one must never wear out one’s welcome, nor choose to remain in any one place for to do so is to risk loosing the ability to adapt to what lies ahead. The road is home and one settles into this home by way of movement and impermanence. Things, every thing, being in perpetual motion, nothing is worthy of contemplation; any consideration is met with haste and all that is worrisome is swept under the carpet. Yet the road conspires with the gods and the soul, and patterns emerge from the flux of things; many faces beginning to blend into one, perhaps the one we miss the most; many places begin to look the same, evoking the same memory; many sorrows crystallize and joy, when it comes, hovers like a misty veil covering it all without discernment.

So time on the road begets reckoning with these emergent commonalities. Some things start to manifest as variations of one particular entity, and as such they start to accompany us, wherever we go and wherever we stay. Contempt for the road begins to fester, and as vibrant action begins to falter and our times of rest begin to extend, the mistress of stability grows in appeal. We have stopped and must rest, and since rest will take a while there is time to think, to reconsider.

Now, years later, I am more settled and much of the road is behind me. The streets that replace it loop back to where I set off on shorter, less adventurous journeys. Unknowns abound, but there’s the semblance of something more stable to which I can retire to and spring back from, perhaps the next day or next month, with a vague sense of serenity around the home base. And from here, I long for the road sometimes. The one that stretches endlessly past the horizon and which, nevertheless, brought me here. And from here, too, I imagine how the road, now distant and ghostly, can lead to nowhere and what traveling on it for too long can do to you. Or what it must be like to travel on it while knowing where you’re headed to, and why.

I wish I could say that I’ve traded the confidence of bustling action for purposeful efforts of lesser intensity and higher efficacy. That the bouncy energy of the youth has been replaced by an endurance of wisdom and grace. But I’m in the solitary plains of the soul, feeling less compelled to act and more riddled with worry. I think two steps ahead and thus, from this biased future, consider all action with stifling skepticism. Beyond confidence there is nothing but the inkling of despair, and this is something to reckon with as one moves on.

So confidence is not followed by confidence. With the continuity broken, am I to do nothing but wait until I succumb to my worrying self, incapable of further action? No is the answer, but I fear we get back on the road much too quickly. While we have lost confidence and while we have not gained much sense of direction, we have acquired perspectives and taking action for action’s sake is unappealing. Some hunch or belief must come before it, like the dark vastness from which the sun shines.

A blow on confidence is not the final stage. It is but a step on the right direction, and although it most likely happen to all, it will manifest in different ways, many of which will have no semblance with others.
