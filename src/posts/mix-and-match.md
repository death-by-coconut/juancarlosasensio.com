Try to imagine what sort of books you’d surround yourself with if your goal was to learn as much as you can about life and living a good one simply from reading them.

What books would be available to you? What titles would you mix and match? Who would have written them? Whatever and whoever they are, they’d somehow need to collaborate with one another, and not a single book or author could possibly give you all the answers. So you’d have to, somehow, make them work together to get what you want. One could pose the question that another would dismiss entirely. 

So, how you go about creating your collection?

Now, imagine how this same little project could change over time. Ten years ago, there’d be less published books than today, possibly millions, and others which are now out of print would be best sellers back then. People would rave about books you now haven’t even heard of, because things change in a decade, even when most things stay the same. And what about ten years from now? What books haven’t been writing? What is it about life that we can’t learn from a book yet?

This is of course a futile project, a thought experiment. Books alone will never give you the answer. Perhaps nothing ever will. But there’s something about your own process of putting together your private little library of living well that could show you what a good life means to you. What would be looking for when looking for your first book on living well? And the next, how does it complement the one you collected before it?
