Making sense of the world is hard. The first time I went rock climbing, the experience was unlike anything else I had ever done before that. Not in a magical or transcendental way, but simply in the way that it’s difficult to relate to a new experience in the moment. The wall was full of weirdly shaped knobs looking like what you’d expect to see at the bottom of an aquarium. Put on the special kind of shoe you need for climbing and feel your foot bend and transform into a claw. Climbing itself requires the body be able to cling, push and pull all at the same time in an awkward vertical dance. An indoor rock climbing gym is its own ecosystem of chiseled, athletic bodies, the stench of sweat and yeasty feet aromas hover permanently as you climb, attempt to climb or attempt to walk here and there with your clawed feet on a bouncy, blue surface.

Everything is new, everything is slightly different than what came before. Perception is heightened and the immediate world is brought into focus, leaving past and future behind, undisturbed, while the novelty persists.

The novel experience ends, and the next phase begins automatically. The self, sort to speak, now needs the new experience to blend with vast collections of experience and somehow fit in as part of the whole. It must relate to other experiences and “making it fit” requires shifting our attention to what is similar, and novelty begins to fade. We wear out novelty to make sense of the experience.

If, instead, what we want is to learn from novelty and somehow preserve its freshness, what we need is reflection. Reflecting is like pickling for new learnings and understanding, preserving their freshness or at least extending its shelf life.

Things happen to us, and we must make sense of them if we are to benefit from them. Writing is the secondary process that allows me to make sense of wildly novel and confusing experiences. It lets me flesh out my thoughts and feelings about something so that it somehow becomes part of the fabric of my being and not merely a stain on a piece of cloth, something that happened to me from which I cannot derive anything but obtuse memories.
