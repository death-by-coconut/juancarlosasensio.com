Without goals, values and priorities, there are no distinctions between distractions and opportunities. Things are vague enough that most anything can be dressed up as growth or learning. There is no failure because there is no proposal.

Even with well-defined goals and priorities, distractions can seem like opportunities. The mind is clever, and often conspires against us. Not all distractions are bad, but most distractions are not opportunities. Saying no allows you to say yes.

Can you afford not being distracted?

From André Aciman,

> And I answer e-mails all the time and I answer phone calls and I don’t mind being interrupted. I don’t mind because I don’t have a very busy social life, so my social life is the interruptions that I get. And if I’m not interrupted, it means I have no friends, and what kind of person is that?
