---The goal of this pen has been to provide an opportunity to learn how to work with React state, specifically how to "lift" a common piece of state and use it across multiple child components, and how to decide what should be the minimal amount information that's kept within the state object. It's a work in progress, as it still needs to calculate a score based on sate.
